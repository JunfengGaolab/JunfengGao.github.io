* Zhu, Z., Hu, H. and Gu, D., 2018, September. Robot Performing Peg-in-Hole Operations by Learning from Human Demonstration. In 2018 10th Computer Science
and Electronic Engineering Conference (CEEC) (pp. 30-35). IEEE.
  * This paper presents a novel approach for a robot to conduct assembly tasks, namely robot learning from human demonstrations. The learning of robotic assembly task is divided into two phases: teaching and reproduction. During the teaching phase, a wrist camera is used to scan the object on the workbench and extract its SIFT feature. The human demonstrator teaches the robot to grasp the object from the effective position and orientation. During the reproduction phase, the robot uses the learned knowledge to reproduce the grasping manipulation autonomously. The robustness of the robotic assembly system is evaluated through a series of grasping trials. The dual-arm Baxter robot is used to perform the Peg-in-Hole task by using the proposed approach. Experimental results show that the robot is able to accomplish assembly task by learning from human demonstration without traditional dedicated programming.
