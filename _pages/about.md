I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate in the <a href="https://lcas.lincoln.ac.uk/wp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lincoln Centre for Autonomous Systems (L-CAS)</a> at the <a href="https://www.lincoln.ac.uk/home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">University of Lincoln</a>.

I am currently involved in the project of '<a href="https://www.agri-tech-e.co.uk/robot-highways-university-of-lincoln-part-of-team-developing-worlds-first-robotic-farm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Robot Highways</a>'. The project, which aims to ensure industry sustainability by addressing labour shortages, the need for global food production and reduce the environmental impact of the farming sector, was awarded funding of Â£2.5m by Innovate UK. 

Previously, I completed my PhD in Computer Science in the group of <a href="https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/computer-science-and-electronic-engineering/research/robotics-and-mechatronics" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Robotics and Mechatronics</a> at the <a href="https://www.essex.ac.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">University of Essex</a>, where I worked on robot learning assembly tasks from observing human demonstrations. 

My goal is to design intelligent algorithms for robots that can help and assist humans in industry. Specifically, I am interested in agri-robotics and how robots learn skills from human demonstrations for robotic assembly. My research lies at the interaction of <var>robotics</var>, <var>computer vision</var>, and <var>machine learning</var>.
