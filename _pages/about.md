I am a Lecturer (~Assistant Professor in US) in Agri-Robotics of the <a href="https://lar.lincoln.ac.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lincoln Agri-Robotic Centre (LAR)</a> and the  <a href="https://lcas.lincoln.ac.uk/wp/people/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lincoln Centre for Autonomous Systems (LCAS)</a> at the <a href="https://www.lincoln.ac.uk/home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">University of Lincoln</a>.

My research mainly focuses on the development of computational models using computer vision and deep learning in the domain of Agriculture, particularly in the robotic applications for autonomous navigation and crop care. Previously, I completed my PhD in machine learning and computer vision for precision farming at the <a href="https://www.ugent.be/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ghent University, Belgium</a>. I also worked at Wageningen University and Research, University of Nottingham, SLU Sweden on agri-robotics and computer vision. He has been serving as deputy programme chair for <a href="https://lcas.lincoln.ac.uk/wp/taros-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TAROS 2021 </a>.

My research lies at the interaction of <var>**robotics**</var>, <var>**computer vision**</var>, and <var>**machine learning**</var> for Agri-food applications.
