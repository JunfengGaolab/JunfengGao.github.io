Junfeng is a Lecturer (~Assistant Professor in US) in Agri-Robotics of the <a href="https://lar.lincoln.ac.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lincoln Agri-Robotic Centre (LAR)</a> and the  <a href="https://lcas.lincoln.ac.uk/wp/people/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lincoln Centre for Autonomous Systems (LCAS)</a> at the <a href="https://www.lincoln.ac.uk/home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">University of Lincoln</a>.

His research mainly focuses on the development of computational models using computer vision and deep learning in the domain of Agriculture, particularly in the robotic applications for autonomous navigation and crop care. Previously, He completed his PhD in machine learning and computer vision for precision farming at <a href="https://www.ugent.be/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ghent University, Belgium</a>. He also worked at Wageningen University and Research, University of Nottingham, SLU Sweden on agri-robotics and computer vision. He has been serving as deputy programme chair for <a href="https://lcas.lincoln.ac.uk/wp/taros-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TAROS 2021</a>. He is one of guest editors for **Agricultural Robotics** special issue for current Robotics Reports and was invited as reviewer for multiple SCI journals.

His research lies at the interaction of **robotics**, **computer vision**, and **machine learning** for Agri-food applications.
