I am finishing my PhD in Computer Science in the group of <a href="https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/computer-science-and-electronic-engineering/research/robotics-and-mechatronics">Robotics and Mechatronics</a> at <a href="https://www.essex.ac.uk/">University of Essex</a>. 

My goal is to design intelligent algorithms for robots that can help and assist humans in their day-to-day lives. Specifically, I am interested in how robots learn skills from human demonstrations for robotic assembly. My research lies at the interaction of <var>robotics</var>, <var>computer vsion</var>, and <var>machine learning</var>.
